Sec/SPI signal peptides often have 1–5 Lys/Arg residues in this region, but a few proteins can function with a minimal or even neutral n‑region.  Here the sequence is short and lacks the typical positive bias, so it is less convincing but still within the range of possible Sec/SPI signals.  \nConclusion: The n‑region is marginally consistent with a Sec/SPI signal peptide, but it is not strongly supportive.\n\nh-region 4-20(QVVLSFALVVVLAVFVG)  \nThis segment is highly hydrophobic, rich in Leu, Val, Ala and Phe, and contains a continuous stretch of non‑polar residues that is characteristic of the Sec/SPI hydrophobic core.

It lacks the one or two positively charged residues (Arg/Lys) that are commonly found in Sec signal peptides, but a neutral n‑region with an N‑terminal methionine is still compatible with Sec pathway targeting.  Thus the n‑region is acceptable, although it is on the weaker side of the typical positive charge requirement.  \nConclusion: Acceptable but weakly charged n‑region.  \n\nh-region 4-20(QVVLSFALVVVLAVFVG)  \nThis stretch is 17 residues long and is dominated by hydrophobic amino acids (Val, Leu, Phe, Ala).  Only a single polar residue (Gln at the very start) and a glycine at the end interrupt the core.  The length and hydrophobicity are typical of Sec signal peptide h‑regions, which usually span 7–15 hydrophobic residues.  Therefore the h‑region is characteristic of a Sec signal peptide.  \nConclusion: Typical Sec h‑region.  \n\nc-region 21-24(QVDS)  \nThe c‑region contains the small, neutral residues required at the -3 and -1 positions for cleavage by Signal Peptidase I: V at -3 and S at -1.  The -2 position is an acidic Asp, which is less common but not forbidden.  Overall, the motif fits the Sec cleavage consensus.  \nConclusion: Consistent with Sec cleavage motif.  \n\nLipid-modified cysteine No information(No information)  \nThe first residue after the predicted cleavage site is a cysteine, but the surrounding sequence does not contain a lipobox (L(A/S)(A/V/I)L).  Thus there is no evidence for lipid modification; the protein is not a lipoprotein.  \nConclusion: No lipid-modified cysteine.  \n\nTwin-arginine motif No information(No information)  \nA Tat signal peptide would contain an RR motif in the n‑region (typically RRXFLK).  This sequence has no consecutive arginines, so it lacks the twin‑arginine motif required for Tat targeting.  \nConclusion: No twin‑arginine motif.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\nType of signal peptide: Sec/SPI  \nCleavage site: 25\n</answer>", "role": "assistant"}]}

This satisfies the requirement for a positively charged n‑region that is typical of Sec‑mediated signal peptides. No other distinctive motifs are present, but the presence of the Lys residue is sufficient to classify it as a legitimate n‑region.  \nConclusion: Consistent with the n‑region of a Sec/SPIII signal peptide.  \n\nh-region No information(No information)  \nFrom residues ~8 to ~24 the sequence is dominated by hydrophobic amino acids (Leu, Ile, Val, Ala, Gly). The hydrophobic core is long and continuous, which is a hallmark of the h‑region of Sec/SPIII signal peptides. The occasional polar residue (Glu at position 11) does not significantly disrupt the overall hydrophobicity.  \nConclusion: Consistent with the h‑region of a Sec/SPIII signal peptide.  \n\nc-region No information(No information)  \nThe C‑terminal part of the signal peptide contains the motif AIA (residues 24–26). The -3 and -1 positions are occupied by small residues (Ala), a motif recognized by the pilin‑processing enzyme PilD. No positively charged residues appear in the c‑region, which is typical for Sec/SPIII signal peptides.  \nConclusion: Consistent with the c‑region of a Sec/SPIII signal peptide.  \n\nLipid‑modified cysteine No information(No information)  \nNo cysteine residue is present in the N‑terminal 20 residues, so there is no lipobox.
